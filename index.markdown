This is the official page for the readong group on $$\beta$$-Factorization Homology run by [Jennifer Brown](http://jmhbrown.github.io/) and Diogo Freire de Andrade in the Fall Semester of the 2023/2024.

## Prerequisites
The seminar is designed for everyone who has been blah blah blah, we have designed it to be as self-contained as possible.

## Seminar Structure:
The seminar will take place ?, in a two-hour lecture format, on ?, from ? in online.

### Outline:
The planned structure for the talks will be as follows:

- **Talk 1**: Motivate derived geometry using intersection theory, using a homological algebra perspective. (Basically, talk about how the derived tensor product is better behaved for non-transverse intersections).
  - [Notes]() by someone.
- **Talk 2**: Alpha Factorization Homology: Definition (I think just left Kan extension stuff): Excision, intuition and compuatations.
  - [Notes]() by someone.
- **Talk 3**: Relationship between $\mathbb{E}_k$-algebras and $$(\infty,k)$$-categories. (Rigidity vs Adjointness). As a specific example talk about $$\mathsf{Alg}_{2}(\mathsf{Cat})$$ vs $$\mathsf{BrTens}$$.
  - [Notes]() by someone.
- **Talk 4**: $$\beta$$-Factorization Homology on $$S^1$$. This isn't published yet. It's basically about Hochschild homology. Talk about tensor excision.
  - [Notes]() by someone
- **Talk 5**: $$\beta$$-Factorization Homology for once-categorified and general topological spaces. This might take longer to come out, which is one reason to do it second. This is also where we'd get into derived skein modules..
  - [Notes]() by someone.
- **Talk 6**: To be determined.
  - [Notes]() by someone.
- **Talk 7**: To be determined.
  - [Notes]() by someone.
